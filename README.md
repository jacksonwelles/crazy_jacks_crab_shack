# Jacks Crab Shack

[Try Me!](https://jacksonwelles.github.io/jacks_crab_shack/)

WIP Personal website built with rust and [leptos](https://leptos.dev/)!

Making this site to throw up cool toy programs (mostly playing with shaders)
and to learn the basics of rust.

I'm planning to style the site like it belongs to a late 2000s crab restaurant.
Why crabs? They're the mascot of rust, and I like the kitschy vibes of cheap
seafood restaruants.
